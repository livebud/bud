# Bud

The Full-Stack Web Framework for Go. Bud writes the boring code for you, helping you launch your website faster.

## Documentation

Read [the documentation](https://denim-cub-301.notion.site/Hey-Bud-4d81622cc49942f9917c5033e5205c69) to learn how to get started with Bud.

# Installing Bud

Bud ships as a single binary that runs on Linux and Mac. You can follow along for Windows support in [this issue](https://github.com/livebud/bud/issues/7).

The easiest way to get started is by copying and pasting the command below in your terminal:

```diff
$ curl -sf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/livebud/bud/main/install.sh | sh
```

This script will download the right binary for your operating system and move the binary to the right location in your `$PATH`.

Confirm that you've installed Bud by typing `bud` in your terminal.

```bash
bud -h
```

You should see the following:

```bash
Usage:
    bud [flags] [command]

Flags:
  -C, --chdir  Change the working directory

Commands:
  build    build the production server
  create   create a new project
  run      run the development server
  tool     extra tools
  version  Show package versions
```

# Requirements

The following software is required to use Bud.

- Node v14+

  This is a temporary requirement that we plan to remove in [v0.3](https://github.com/livebud/bud/discussions/21)

- Go v1.16+

  Bud relies heavily on `io/fs` and will take advantage of generics in the future, so while Go v1.16 will work, we suggest running Go v1.18+ if you can.

# Your First Project

With bud installed, you can now scaffold a new project:

```bash
$ bud create hello
$ cd hello
```

The create command will scaffold everything you need to get started with bud.

```bash
$ ls
go.mod  node_modules/  package-lock.json  package.json
```

... which is not very much by the way! Unlike most other fullstack frameworks, Bud starts out very minimal. As you add dependencies, Bud will generate all the boring code to glue your app together. Let's see this in action.

Start the development server with `bud run`:

```bash
$ bud run
| Listening on http://127.0.0.1:3000
```

Congrats! You're running your first web server with Bud. The welcome server is your jumping off point to learn more about the framework.

## How did Bud come into existence?

I started working on Bud two years ago after seeing how productive people could be in [Laravel](https://laravel.com/), and I wanted the same for Go, so I decided to try creating Laravel for the Go ecosystem. However, my first version after 6 months needed to scaffold many files just to get started. If you are coming from [Rails](https://github.com/rails/rails) or Laravel you may shrug and consider this as pretty normal. 

Unfortunately, I have also been spoiled by the renaissance in frontend frameworks like [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) that start barebones and then every file you add incrementally enhances your web application. This keeps the initial complexity under control.

With this additional inspiration, I worked on the next iteration for the ensuing 18 months. 

The goals are now:

* Generate files only as you need them. Keep these generated files away from your application code and give developers the choice to keep them out of source control.

* Feel like using a modern JS framework. This means it should work with [multiple](https://github.com/livebud/bud/discussions/8) modern frontend frameworks like [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) and [React](https://reactjs.org/), support [live reload](https://denim-cub-301.notion.site/Hey-Bud-4d81622cc49942f9917c5033e5205c69#4c7dff15ef3e458587b81fb9b1819afb), and have [server-side rendering](https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/uoxocj/bud_the_fullstack_web_framework_for_go_developers/i8ke92h/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) for better performance and SEO.

* The framework should be extensible from Day 1. Bud is too ambitious for one person. We're going to need an ambitious community behind this framework.

* Bud should provide high-level APIs for developers while using performant low-level Go code under the covers.

* Bud should compile to a single binary that contains the entire web app and can be copied to a server that doesn't even have Go installed.
